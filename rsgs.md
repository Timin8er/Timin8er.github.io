## **Overview**
A robotic servicing vehicle comprised of a robotic payload and a spacecraft bus will be jointly developed by DARPA, and the partner team selected. The long-term vision of the RSGS program is to enable a persistent, reliable, cost-effective cooperative robotic servicing capability in GEO, beginning with the robotic servicer developed under the RSGS program and operated by a commercial entity

## **Project Goals**
 - Demonstrate in or near GEO that a robotic servicing vehicle can perform safe, reliable, useful and efficient operations, with the flexibility to adapt to a variety of on-orbit missions and conditions
 - Demonstrate satellite servicing mission operations on operational GEO satellites in collaboration with commercial and U.S. Government spacecraft operators
 - Support the development of a servicer spacecraft with sufficient propellant and payload robustness to enable dozens of missions over several years

## **My Role**
I was Software Lead on apps for planning payload operations and interfacing with the simulation environment.

## **Robot Operation Tool Kit, ROTK**
A database centric approch to planning and commanding, the ROTK is a collection of software used to plan operations, screen commands, and interface with the payload.

### **Achievements**
- Wrote apps to receive telemetry, real time reporting, and initializing simulations
- Created database centric apps for tracking data revisions
- Wrote planning software for creating executable operation procedures

### Key Technologies:
- Python
- C++
- Docker
- MySql
