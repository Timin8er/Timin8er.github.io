[Link](https://www.darpa.mil/program/robotic-servicing-of-geosynchronous-satellites)

 ### Project Overview

 - Demonstrate in or near GEO that a robotic servicing vehicle can perform safe, reliable, useful and efficient operations, with the flexibility to adapt to a variety of on-orbit missions and conditions
 - Demonstrate satellite servicing mission operations on operational GEO satellites in collaboration with commercial and U.S. Government spacecraft operators
 - Support the development of a servicer spacecraft with sufficient propellant and payload robustness to enable dozens of missions over several years
