### Overview
A robotic servicing vehicle comprised of a robotic payload and a spacecraft bus will be jointly developed by DARPA, and the partner team selected. The long-term vision of the RSGS program is to enable a persistent, reliable, cost-effective cooperative robotic servicing capability in GEO, beginning with the robotic servicer developed under the RSGS program and operated by a commercial entity

### Project Goals
 - Demonstrate in or near GEO that a robotic servicing vehicle can perform safe, reliable, useful and efficient operations, with the flexibility to adapt to a variety of on-orbit missions and conditions
 - Demonstrate satellite servicing mission operations on operational GEO satellites in collaboration with commercial and U.S. Government spacecraft operators
 - Support the development of a servicer spacecraft with sufficient propellant and payload robustness to enable dozens of missions over several years

## Robot Operation Tool Kit, ROTK
The ROTK is a collection of software used to plan operations, screen commands, and interface with the payload.

## My Role
I was lead developer on apps for planning payload operations and interfacing with the simulation environment.

### Achievements
- Wrote apps to receive telemetry for real time reporting and initializing simulations
- Created database for tracking data revisions
- Wrote apps for turning planning data into executable operation procedures
- Developed the software deployment pipeline
